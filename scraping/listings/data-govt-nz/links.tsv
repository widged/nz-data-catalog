The Bill was the outcome of years of meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often travelling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions and sign petitions. A number of petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament from the early 1880s till 1893. Only two of these historically important documents are known to have survived and both are preserved at Archives New Zealand.The 1893 Women's Suffrage Petition [Archives Ref:Le1 1893/7a] and this dataset contains the signatories given names/title, surname, given address, city/region and a notes field which for example may name a witness for those who signed as X because they were illiterate.

Where building records are not complete, the map is useful for discovering whether present-day buildings were in existence before 1892. It also hints at the nature of the late 19th century city where high-density housing is evident in some parts.<br /></p><p>The rectification of the Thomas Ward maps was completed by the GIS Operations Team at Wellington City Council.  As the scanned images had some skew, the rectification process was unable to be carried out to a high level of accuracy.  The quality of the rectification of the images also depends on the accuracy of the 2011 cadastre vector data which was used as base data as well as the content coverage of the maps to find sufficient and reliable reference points.<br />Please note that a best-fit recitfication over each individual map sheet was attempted, so generally the whole sheet is located correctly, but accuracy of features at any particular location may be slightly misaligned.<br /></p><p>The geofereferenced Thomas Ward maps should only be used as a guide as to the location of historic features.<br /></p>	kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	Yes	a download and/or courier fee applies.

Antarctic Geodetic Marks	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/789-antarctic-geodetic-marks/	dataset	Land Information New Zealand	Land Information New Zealand	customersupport@linz.govt.nz		<p>This dataset provides information about the position, position accuracy, mark name, mark type, condition and unique four letter code for geodetic marks in terms of New Zealand's official geodetic datum for the Ross Dependency. </p><p>This dataset only includes marks that are within Antarctica. These positions have been generated using geodetic observations such as precise differential GPS or electronic distance and theodolite angles measurements. The positions are either 2D or 3D depending of the availability of this measurement data. </p><p>The source data is from Land Information New Zealand's (LINZ) Landonline system where it is used by Land Surveyors. This dataset is updated daily to reflect changes made in the Landonline.</p><h4>Accuracy</h4><p>Geodetic marks with a coordinate order of 5 or less have been positioned in terms of Ross Sea Region Geodetic Datum 2000 (RSRGD2000) using precise differential GPS techniques. Marks with order 6 have been positioned in terms of RSRGD2000 using precise horizontal angles and distance measurements. Lower order marks (order 7 and greater) are derived from lower accuracy measurement techniques or historical datum transformations, and may be significantly less accurate. </p><p>The accuracy of RSRGD2000 coordinates is described by a series of 'orders' classifications. Positions in terms of RSRGD2000 are described by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). The accuracy of a survey mark is indicated by its order. Orders are classifications based on the quality of the coordinate in relation to the datum and in relation to other surrounding marks. For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heights/heights/coordinate-orders/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heigh...</a></p><p>Note that the accuracy applies at the time the mark was last surveyed. Refer to the web geodetic database for historical information about mark coordinates. </p><p>Note also that the existence of a mark in this dataset does not imply that there is currently a physical mark in the ground - the dataset includes destroyed or lost historical marks. The geodetic database provides more information on the mark status, valid at last time it was visited by LINZ.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2011-08-02 17:19:36		2015-09-26 08:06:38	2012-03-17 19:23:48	tag:data.linz.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:789

Archway Accessions List	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/archway-accessions-list	dataset	Department of Internal Affairs	Webmaster	webmaster-archives@dia.govt.nz	04 499 5595	An accession is a discrete group of records transferred into archival custody by a single agency on a specific date.Each accession is assigned a unique numeric code (an accession number) to distinguish it from others and this code is used to manage and control Archives NZ work flow for the records within the accession. The accession codes are prefixed by A, CH, D or W for Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin and Wellington offices respectively. Not all assigned accession codes are linked to a list of transferred records. There can be several reasons for this including uncompleted transfers.Archives NZ has assigned over 9000 accession codes to date.  The accessions shown here are only those with a connection to a list of records as at June 2013. This data is intended to provide a preview of Archives New Zealand's collections. Accessions and their related lists are being added constantly so Archway at www.archway.archives.govt.nz should be consulted for the most up to date and accurate information.

Archway Agency List	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/archway-agency-list	dataset	Department of Internal Affairs	Webmaster	webmaster-archives@dia.govt.nz	04 499 5595	Agency documentation is an important part of Archives New Zealand's descriptive model for its archival holdings. An 'agency' is any organisational entity which has engaged in recordkeeping activities such as creating, controlling or transferring public records of archival value to Archives NZ. An agency is normally an independent business with its own record-keeping system. It may be linked to other agencies, most commonly those that came before or after it, or were in control of or controlled by it.There are 5740 approved agencies documented in Archway (Archives New Zealand's online finding aids database) as at 26 June 2013.  These agencies are categorised into the following types:Person (Individuals who transfer records to Archives New Zealand)                         Central government agency                 Local government agency                   District Health Boards                             State schools               Universities                                         Polytechnics                  Other, including Courts, State Owned Enterprises and private companies                              The agencies listed here are only a subset of those documented on Archway. The 'Person' agencies have been excluded and also those agencies not documented to full descriptive standard on Archway. The brief information given here is intended to provide a glimpse of how agencies are displayed in our finding aids system. Full agency documentation includes a summary; an administrative history; links to predecessor/successor and superior/subordinate relationships and links to the records series controlled by the agency.

Christchurch Drainage Datum (CDD) heights have been computed in the Christchurch area from NZGD2000 ellipsoidal heights by subtracting NZGeoid2009 geoid heights and adding an offset of 0.523m (specifically calculated for Christchurch City) to bring in terms of Lyttelton Vertical Datum 1937 (for Christchurch) and a further offset of 9.04m to bring in terms of CDD.</p><p>The model used to estimate whether movements greater than 2cm occurred at a mark (excluding those due to liquefaction or other localised deformation) after the 2010-09-04 earthquake was provided by GNS Science (Darfield_Sep2010_model_8.5_grid_displacements_calcs.xls).

This layer supercedes the Groundwater Recharge Zones 1A, 1B, and 1C layer as shown in Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan 2004. Groundwater recharge means the replenishment of groundwater by infiltration or seepage of water. Includes both rainfall and river recharge of groundwater, and in some areas may include losses through the soil of irrigation water. Variation 6 introduces a new issue, objective, policies and methods, including land use rules and amendments to the existing water quality zone boundaries, relating specifically to the Christchurch Aquifer System. Variation 6 applies to the area of Christchurch City (excluding Banks Peninsula) and also that part of Selwyn District north of Halkett Road. This amendment was brought about as part of delivering on the Greater Christchurch Urban Devlopment Strategy.Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone:(Refer Chapter 5: Rule WQN15)The Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone comprises part of the urban area of Christchurch City and the land to the west overlying unconfined groundwater. This area is the source of water for the Coastal Confined Gravel Aquifer System from which the city takes its water supply. The Recharge Zone is divided into two zones. Zone 1 is the predominately rural area to the west of the City bounded by the Waimakariri River and a line approximately between Halkett, Prebbleton and the Port Hills. It is an area of permeable gravels containing unconfined shallow groundwater that is at risk of contamination from land use. Within Zone 1 three sub-zones are identified:(a) Zone 1A Christchurch International Airport;(b) Zone 1B existing business areas; and(c) Zone 1C mineral extraction.Zone 2 comprises the existing urban area between Johns and Russley Roads, Marshlands Road and the base of the Port Hills.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2015-06-08 09:30:10		2015-08-03 03:34:13	2015-02-10 02:46:30	tag:data.canterburymaps.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:7516

Christchurch Traffic API	https://infoconnect.highwayinfo.govt.nz/opencms/opencms/InfoConnect/for-developers/christchurch-api.html	dataset	Christchurch City Council	Sonia Pollard	sonia.pollard@tfc.govt.nz	03 941 8218	The TMP for Chch API lets you access information on all known planned events on the roading network within the Christchurch City boundary including Banks Peninsula i.e. the area bounded by the following co-ordinates: West Bounding Coordinate 172.393024; East Bounding Coordinate 172.808181; North Bounding Coordinate -43.390128; South Bounding Coordinate -43.628620.The API makes available two sets of data:1.Road works: This is a list of roadwork locations on the Christchurch Roading Network, along with details of the duration of the work and impacts.2.Planned public events: This is a list of planned public events within Christchurch that have an associated temporary traffic management plan, including the duration of any road closures and impacts to transport associated with the public event (such as the Christchurch Marathon).The data is sourced from the Christchurch Transport Operations Centres’ (CTOC) Temporary Traffic Management Database (TMPforCHCH.co.nz) and published on the TransportforChristchurch website. If you already subscribe to the NZTA’s TREIS highway Info API, you may find some duplication in the information you receive relating to the State Highways within the Christchurch City boundaries, specifically around significant road works and public events which impact a state highway. The two systems have different business rules around the data provided. NZTA and the CTOC can not take any responsibility for duplication in the data and it is our expectation that developers using these two feeds will apply their own filters to ensure duplication is removed.

Since attributes have measurable values, FDLs are particularly useful in computer modelling and have enabled researchers and resource management decision-makers to make the most of rapid developments in GIS technology. Key soil attributes were selected through a consultation process with stakeholders, and generally fall into three groups: soil fertility/toxicity, soil physical properties (particularly those related to soil moisture), and topography/climate (T). Parameters include slope, potential rooting depth, topsoil gravel content, proportion of rock outcrop, pH, salinity, cation exchange capacity, total carbon, phosphorus retention, flood interval, soil temperature, total profile available water, profile readily available water, drainage, and macropores (shallow and deep).<br /></p><p>Regional soil databases were the key to generating FDLs. New Zealand was subdivided into several geographic regions and soil scientists were allocated a region for which they developed a â€˜regional legendâ€™, i.e. database. Regional data were correlated using the New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC), referenced to the National Soils Database (NSD) and other relevant data sources, and then linked to the soil polygons in the New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI).

To extract as much information as possible from these data, a surface was fitted first that predicted for each month the ratio of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface to that reaching the top of the atmosphere, with the latter calculated from solar geometry equations. In fitting this surface, only the 18 data points where measurements were made of both solar radiation and sunshine hours were used.<br /></p><p>In addition to NZMG coordinates, it used as an additional predictor the ratio of measured sunshine hours for each month to the maximum possible sunshine hours given no cloud. This surface was then used to estimate the monthly solar radiation received at each of the 80 sites for which measurements of sunshine hours alone were available. Using a total of 98 sites for which solar radiation data were either measured directly or estimated from sunshine hours, surfaces predicting annual and monthly solar radiation were then fitted. Data describing monthly humidity was used as a surrogate measure of cloudiness to improve the fit of the surface to the underlying data. This also increases the local accuracy of the surface predictions, as the number of meteorological stations used to fit the humidity surface is more than three times greater than the number of sites used to fit the solar radiation surface.<br /></p><p>The units for this layer are in MJ/m2/day, higher values signifiy areas that have higher levels of solar radiation.

The non-temporal changes include errors in the earlier mappings and linework refinement, including reversal of over-smoothed hand-drawn linework in v3.0. Errors were identified from; a review of low producing grassland in the South Island, updates from MfE's Kyoto Land Use maps, checks of the dating of v3.0 mapped change, and feedback from users. An â€œEditDateâ€ and â€œAuthorityâ€ attribute are available in this layer indicating the date and source of the change for both non-temporal and temporal changes mapped. The Authority attribute indicates who (or who's dataset) identified the change. Note, where minor line-work improvements were applied using automated processes, the EditDate and Authorify have not been changed (but the â€œNonTemporalâ€ attribute is still set true). This layer was produced with a tolerance of 50cm as a zero tolerance generates slivers too small for the portal software to project correctly. Funding is from the Ministry for Science and Innovation under contract CO9X1101, which was contributed to by the Ministry for the Environment.

It is a comprehensive, technical, peer-reviewed update of the Canterbury Regional Landscape Study of 1993, which was one of the first regional landscape analyses completed in response to the 1991 Resource Management Act in New Zealand.The report builds upon the methods used in 1993 and reflects current best practice in landscape assessment. It is intended to provide a basis for informing further detailed landscape studies in the region. The focus of the report is on large-scale landscape patterns that are able to be distinguished at a regional level, rather than site specific analysis. Detailed studies are likely to identify more features that are distinguishable at a local level, as well as refine specific boundaries in response to finer grained analysis.</p><p>Copyright statement: Boffa Miskell/Environment Canterbury</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2015-06-08 09:30:09		2015-08-03 01:05:27	2015-02-10 06:46:18	tag:data.canterburymaps.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:7603

Mudfish Habitat	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7524-mudfish-habitat/	dataset	Canterbury Regional Council	Canterbury Maps Partners	ecinfo@ecan.govt.nz		<p>Mudfish(Refer Chapter 5: Rule WQN20The Department of Conservationâ€™s New Zealand mudfish (Neochanna spp.) recovery plan 2003-13, has identified the Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) as acutely threatened. Mudfish are characteristically hard to find. The adults are nocturnal, and the species' ability to aestivate (burrow into mud for periods of several weeks) adds to the difficulty of identifying their presence.The places indicated on the planning maps have all been verified since 2000, but even recent observations can be difficult to replicate, and new discoveries are still being made. For mapping purposes, information recorded for a site has been extrapolated in the light of known mudfish behaviour to include areas of the same waterbody beyond the actual record site.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2015-06-08 09:30:10		2015-08-03 03:34:21	2015-02-10 02:46:35	tag:data.canterburymaps.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:7524

NRRP Christchurch Groundwater Protection Zone	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7517-nrrp-christchurch-groundwater-protection-zone/	dataset	Canterbury Regional Council	Canterbury Maps Partners	ecinfo@ecan.govt.nz		<p>Christchurch Groundwater Protection Zones as ammended by Variation 6 to the Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan, Chapter 4: Water Quality. This layer supercedes the Groundwater Recharge Zones layer as shown in Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan 2004. Groundwater recharge means the replenishment of groundwater by infiltration or seepage of water. Includes both rainfall and river recharge of groundwater, and in some areas may include losses through the soil of irrigation water. Variation 6 introduces a new issue, objective, policies and methods, including land use rules and amendments to the existing water quality zone boundaries, relating specifically to the Christchurch Aquifer System. Variation 6 applies to the area of Christchurch City (excluding Banks Peninsula) and also that part of Selwyn District north of Halkett Road. This amendment was brought about as part of delivering on the Greater Christchurch Urban Devlopment Strategy.Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone:(Refer Chapter 5: Rule WQN15)The Christchurch Groundwater Recharge Zone comprises part of the urban area of Christchurch City and the land to the west overlying unconfined groundwater. This area is the source of water for the Coastal Confined Gravel Aquifer System from which the city takes its water supply. The Recharge Zone is divided into two zones.

An order aims to recognise the outstanding amenity or intrinsic values that water provides, in either a natural or modified state. Orders may be applied over rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, wetlands, or aquifers, and can cover freshwater or geothermal water. If granted by the Minister, a Water Conservation Order can restrict or prohibit water â€˜takesâ€™, discharges and other uses of the water. Water Conservation Orders can be used to preserve that natural state or protect characteristics such as: the water body's value as a habitat or fishery its wild and scenic nature its value for recreational, historic, spiritual, cultural or scenic purposes. A water body may also hold particular significance for Maori. Applications to the Minister must set out the reasons for the application. If the Minister accepts the application then he or she must appoint a special tribunal to hear and report on the application. The special tribunal then publicly notifies the application and calls for submissions. Submissions must be lodged within 20 working days of the public notice unless a later date is set. Any person may make a submission to the special tribunal. The tribunal then holds a hearing and prepares a report on the application, which will include either a draft Water Conservation Order or a recommendation that the application be declined. This report is sent to the applicant, the Minister, the relevant local and iwi authorities, and every submitter. Anyone who made a submission has a further right of submission to the Environment Court on the special tribunal's report. The Environment Court must hold an inquiry if it receives one or more submissions. If there is such an application to the Environment Court, once it has completed its inquiry, the Environment Court makes a report to the Minister recommending that the special tribunal's report be accepted or rejected with or without modifications. The Minister must make a recommendation to the Governor-General in accordance with the report of the special tribunal or, if the Environment Court has held an inquiry, the report of the Environment Court. If a Water Conservation Order is recommended, the Governor-General then makes the order â€” by order in council. An order can prohibit or restrict a regional council issuing new water and discharge permits, although it can not affect existing permits. Regional policy statements, regional plans and district plans must be consistent with the provisions of a Water Conservation Order.

(1976) subdivided the New Zealand mainland (North, South, and Stewart Islands, plus nearby inshore islands) into 29 approximately equalsized areas, and defined two-letter codes for each. The codes and boundary definitions for these areas were provided on a separate, large map enclosed with the journal issue. These areas were modified from the areas used as weather forecast districts by the New Zealand Meteorological Service, and their main purpose was to facilitate the arrangement, retrieval, and documentation of specimens in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection (NZAC). The codes have subsequently been used in other collections, for computer databases, and in publications as a convenient way of categorising specimen data.<br /></p><p>The New Zealand Journal of Zoology paper is provided here as an attachment to this record and is available for download.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Landcare Data Use License	http://lris.scinfo.org.nz/license/landcare-data-use-licence-v1/	2011-07-27 13:10:52		2010-12-13 15:30:52	2010-12-13 15:30:52	tag:lris.scinfo.org.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:165

These positions have been generated using geodetic observations such as precise differential GPS or electronic distance and theodolite angles measurements. The positions are either 2D or 3D depending of the availability of this measurement data. </p><p>The source data is from Land Information New Zealand's (LINZ) Landonline system where it is used by Land Surveyors. This dataset is updated daily to reflect changes made in the Landonline.</p><h4>Accuracy</h4><p>Geodetic marks with a coordinate order of 5 or less have been positioned in terms of NZGD2000. Lower order marks (order 6 and greater) are derived from cadastral surveys, lower accuracy measurement techniques or inaccurate historical datum transformations, and may be significantly less accurate. </p><p>The accuracy of NZGD2000 coordinates is described by a series of 'orders' classifications. Positions in terms of NZGD2000 are described by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). The accuracy of a survey mark is indicated by its Order. Orders are classifications based on the quality of the coordinate in relation to the datum and in relation to other surrounding marks. For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heights/heights/coordinate-orders/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/datums-projections-heigh...</a> </p><p>Note that the accuracy applies at the time the mark was last surveyed. Refer to the web geodetic database for historical information about mark coordinates. </p><p>Note also that the existence of a mark in this dataset does not imply that there is currently a physical mark in the ground - the dataset includes destroyed or lost historical marks.

The Landonline system which manages the data maintains non-spatial parcels for many different reasons. The non-spatial parcels can only be accessed via WFS or as a full layer file download. No layer clips can be used. The most common reasons for non-spatial parcels are:</p><ol><li><p>Flats and unit survey plans will create non-spatial parcels for referencing property rights. This is because the Landonline system has not yet been designed to support the spatial definition of these plans.</p></li><li><p>Titles which were not linked to a spatial parcel during the Landonline title conversion project created non-spatial parcel references. As titles are spatially linked many of these non-spatial parcels will be made historic or will be merged with the associated spatial parcel.</p></li></ol><p>Parcels within this layer contain the following status flags:</p><ul><li><p>Approved: The definition of a survey-defined parcel that has been processed and authorised as correct in terms of the survey network.</p></li><li><p>Current: A parcels that has been registered or the parcel is made current by a statutory action against a Legalisation plan.</p></li><li><p>Survey Historic: A parcel that has been extinguished from the primary cadastral network but still exists in live Title estates.</p></li><li><p>Historic: A parcel that has been extinguished from the primary cadastral network and no longer exists in live Title estates or has an current recorded statutory action. Typically this happens when a parcel is subdivided or merged, and new titles or actions are registered against the replacing parcels. Note: Only parcel made historic since the beginning of Landonline operations (2002) are included. See this <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/survey-titles/landonline-data/landonline-bde/related-datasets/dcdb-datasets">page</a> for the actual dates when Landonline operations started.</p></li></ul><p>The Linear parcels within this layer has a nominal accuracy of 0.1-1m in urban areas and 1-100m in rural areas. For more detailed information about parcel accuracies please refer to the <a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/774-nz-survey-boundary-marks">Survey Boundary Marks</a> layer which contains accuracies for each parcel node. </p><p>The originating data for parcel/title associations includes some non-official sources where the official data does not support a link.

NZ SPI Adjustments	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/835-nz-spi-adjustments/	dataset	Land Information New Zealand	Land Information New Zealand	customersupport@linz.govt.nz		<p>This layer provides the extents of the data incorporated into an adjustment which has been completed as part of the Spatial Parcel Improvement (SPI) project. The SPI project aims to improve the accuracy of digital cadastral data in areas (primarily rural) where survey-accurate data does not currently exist. The improvement of coordinates is controlled by a mathematical adjustment process using a Least Squares methodology. The adjustment/integration process results in increased mapping accuracy of surrounding spatial objects (e.g. parcels), the effect of which is some new observations or parcels appear to move. The extent of the change largely depends upon the accuracy of the underlying data. In general, movements will be at least several metres, as the SPI project targets areas where significant movements are expected.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2011-08-02 17:19:36		2015-09-26 08:07:59	2012-03-17 19:24:53	tag:data.linz.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:835

NZ Street Address (Electoral)	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/779-nz-street-address-electoral/	dataset	Land Information New Zealand	Land Information New Zealand	customersupport@linz.govt.nz		<p>This layer provides all allocated addresses as advised to LINZ by Territorial Authorities (TAs).  Under the Local Government Act 1974 (section 319) it is the responsibility of the TAs to advise LINZ (the Surveyor General) of all allocated addresses in their district.<br /></p><hr /><p>Local Government Act 1974<br /><strong>319B Allocation of property numbers</strong><br />(1) For electoral, postal, and other purposes the council may allocate a number to any area of land or building or part of a building within its district and may change the number allocated to any such area of land or building.<br />(2) The council shall comply with any request from a Chief Surveyor to allocate a number to or change the number of any area of land or building or part of a building in its district.<br />(3) The principal administrative officer shall advise the Chief Surveyor of the land district in which the land or building is situated of the numbers allocated under subsection (1) or subsection (2).<br /></p><hr /><p>Generally allocated addresses will be represented by a single point.  However there was an historical practice to represent only the principal address allocated by Territorial Authorities, and not include addresses assigned to individual flats.  Similarly there was an historical practice to aggregate addresses into ranges, especially where there are many addresses for a single parcel. We are working (where possible) to resolve these historical anomalies and have each allocated address represented where possible.  The datasets also includes addresses where the Surveyor General has requested (under the Local Government Act) that a TA allocated an address.<br /></p><p>The road name and locality fields attributed to an address are taken from the associated road attributes.  These roads are stored as centrelines (see NZ Road Centre Line (Electoral)) and reflect the road names as assigned by the TA responsible.  The locality name ensures that if duplicate road names exist in TA that the number/road combination can still be unique by using the locality field.<br /></p><p>Wherever address points have been provided in spatial data files by a TA, LINZ will import this data and use the exact location as defined by the TA.  Where non spatial data is provided LINZ adds the location of an address point with the mandatory priority to locate that address point within the correct meshblock. The location of the front door of an elector's dwelling within the correct meshblock is a fundamental requirement of the electoral system (Section 72 Electoral Act 1993).  Highly desirable priorities for the location of an address point are to have it in the same property and parcel as the dwelling and on the correct side of the physical and legal roads. It is also a desirable priority to have the address point in the same location as the dwelling and/or at the location of the property entrance.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2011-08-02 17:19:35		2015-09-26 08:06:54	2012-03-17 19:25:37	tag:data.linz.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:779

It was intended to "back-capture" approximately 70 percent of existing parcels, which equates to about 20 percent of the land area of New Zealand.</p><p>The data capture known as "Populate Electronic Parcel" (PEP) was undertaken under contract by EDS.</p><p>The areas to be captured known as "Survey Capture Areas" (SCA) were defined in consultation with local LINZ staff, survey practitioners and Local Authorities.</p><p>Within the defined SCAs, the dimensions for surveyed right-lined boundaries of current parcels were captured from existing survey plans. In addition, sufficient traverses, boundary ties, and connections to the geodetic control were captured or surveyed to ensure adequate network geometry and strengthen areas where the boundary dimensions are unreliable. This survey network was adjusted to generate modern survey coordinates for all relevant nodes. Where the resulting boundaries comply with the accuracy requirements of the 1998 Survey Regulations, then the adjusted co-ordinates were declared to have SDC (Survey-accurate Digital Cadastre) status.</p><p>For more information see <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/survey-titles/landonline-data/landonline-bde/related-datasets/dcdb-datasets/survey-conversion">here</a></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2011-08-02 17:19:36		2011-07-22 14:56:48	2011-07-22 14:56:48	tag:data.linz.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:840

These positions have been generated using geodetic observations such as precise differential GPS or electronic distance and theodolite angle measurements. The positions are either 2D or 3D depending of the availability of this measurement data. </p><p>The source data is from Land Information New Zealand's (LINZ) Landonline system where it is used by Land Surveyors. This dataset is updated daily to reflect changes made in the Landonline.</p><p>The mark network is segmented into six control networks which provide control marks for specific purposes. The control_network field within this layer records this network with the 3 or 4 letter abbreviation code as follows:</p><pre><code>NRF  - National Reference Frame  NDMN - National Deformation Monitoring Network  RDMN - Regional Deformation Monitoring Network  LDMN - Local Deformation Monitoring Network  CHN  - Cadastral Horizontal Control Network  CVN  - Cadastral Vertical Control Network  BGN  - Basic Geospatial Network  NHN  - National Height Network</code></pre><p>Note a geodetic mark can be in more than network. Also not all geodetic marks are currently associated with a geodetic network. Those that are may be referred to as a control mark. For more information about the control networks refer to <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/geodetic-programme/survey-control-networks/">www.linz.govt.nz/geodetic/geodetic-programme/surve...</a>. </p><h4>Accuracy</h4><p>Geodetic marks with a coordinate order of 5 or less have been positioned in terms of NZGD2000. Lower order marks (order 6 and greater) are derived from cadastral surveys, lower accuracy measurement techniques or inaccurate historical datum transformations, and may be significantly less accurate. </p><p>The accuracy of NZGD2000 coordinates is described by a series of 'orders' classifications. Positions in terms of NZGD2000 are described by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, ellipsoidal height). The accuracy of a survey mark is indicated by its order. Orders are classifications based on the quality of the coordinate in relation to the datum and in relation to other surrounding marks.

Refer to the web geodetic database for historical information about mark coordinates. </p><p>Note also that the existence of a mark in this dataset does not imply that there is currently a physical mark in the ground - the dataset includes destroyed or lost historical marks.

NZ WACA Adjustments	https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/836-nz-waca-adjustments/	dataset	Land Information New Zealand	Land Information New Zealand	customersupport@linz.govt.nz		<p>This layer provides the extents of the data incorporated into an adjustment which has been completed as a Wide Area Cadastral Adjustment (WACA). These adjustments are undertaken in areas where there is already substantial survey-accurate data, but there are some inconsistencies in the data resulting from small changes to geodetic control coordinates and/or the progressive submission of additional Cadastral Survey Datasets (CSDs). The improvement of coordinates is controlled by a mathematical adjustment process using a Least Squares methodology. The adjustment/integration process results in increased mapping accuracy of surrounding spatial objects (e.g. parcels), the effect of which is some new observations or parcels appear to move. The extent of the change largely depends upon the accuracy of the underlying data. In general, movements will be no more than 10cm, as the WACAs target areas where coordinates already have fairly high spatial accuracy.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2011-08-02 17:19:36		2015-09-26 08:07:53	2012-03-17 19:24:56	tag:data.linz.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:836

NZDF Personnel File List	http://archives.govt.nz/has/open-data/nzdf-personnel-file-list	dataset	Department of Internal Affairs	Webmaster	webmaster-archives@dia.govt.nz	04 499 5595	Archives New Zealand holds over 140,000 military personnel files of those who served in the New Zealand Defence Forces up to the end of 1920, including the South African War and WWI.  These records were transferred from various NZDF agencies over recent years, with about 29 transfers from NZDF Personnel Archives in the last decade.As each transfer was completed the data format and logic sequence was maintained within each accession as part of the process.  Records were also processed to link to various agencies, and categorised into different series by the nature of the record and their relationships.  This means the NZDF personnel files are dispersed into various series and accessions, and to access all of these records users need to have in-depth knowledge about the evolution of NZDF and about how archives are managed.This list aims to help people overcome the above obstacles through standardising the format of names and sorting all entries into a unique sequence (alphabetical order by surname) across all transfers of NZDF personnel files, which will support the most simple and common access path to these records by users.NZDF personnel files are composed of the original personnel files, military history sheets, and microfilm strip copies of original personnel files that were destroyed after microfilming in the 1970s.  Each entry in the list is a surrogate of a file within our collection, however individuals could have more than one file.It should also be noted that this list is no more than reorganisation of the dataset of Archives’ finding aids Archway, any real requests should be made through Archway with the related archives reference.

The databank both a physical archive and computer databank containing records from approximately 45,000 vegetation survey plots spanning more than 50 years, of indigenous and exotic plants in New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems, from Northland to Stewart Island and the Kermadec and Chatham islands.<br /><br />The data can be used to describe plant species occurrence and abundance, vegetation structure, and environmental variables over a broad range of habitats and represent over 4 million records across 3,500 separate datasets. The strategic goals for NVS include a strong emphasis on effective and secure data management, databank growth and increase uptake, and increased effectiveness in use. To fulfilling these goals requires state-of-the-art data management of a continually growing resource, leadership in data integration and synthesis, and, anticipating and meeting the needs of end-users.	online database	Other-Unknown	Unknown		Feed	Other licensing (check with source agency)		2011-06-08 17:54:42		2010-12-01 00:00:00		http://geospatial.govt.nz/browse-data-or-resources/dogetrecordbyid/a7e32928-ffff-410f-86d8-b696ac002398

New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators 2011	http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/new-zealand-maternity-clinical-indicators-2011	dataset	Ministry of Health		data-enquiries@moh.govt.nz		The New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators are the result of collaboration between the Ministry of Health and maternity stakeholders, representing consumer, midwifery, obstetric, general practice, paediatric and anaesthetic perspectives. Building on previous work undertaken across Australasia, an expert working group has established a set of 12 maternity clinical indicators that are relevant to the New Zealand setting and can be measured using available data collections. This third report presents data for 2011 using the same standardised definitions as in the previous two reports (2009 and 2010).  This is also the third report using the standard primipara definition which allows the separate assessment of a group of women for whom interventions and outcomes should be similar. In addition to eight indicators for standard primiparae, there are three indicators for all women giving birth in hospital and one indicator covering all babies born in hospital. This report provides an opportunity for district health boards (DHBs) and local maternity stakeholders to identify areas for further investigation at a local level as part of local maternity quality and safety programmes. A time series view of three years of indicators data as an interactive dataset accompanies this third report and enables analysis of local and national trends over time.

In 2011 an expert working group established a set of 12 maternity clinical indicators that could be measured using the available data collections at that time.In 2013 the National Maternity Monitoring Group reviewed the original indicator set and recommended a range of changes to improve the quality, completeness and scope of the New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators. These proposed changes were further reviewed and developed by the original expert working group to ensure the objectives of the New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators were retained; that being a tool for assessing the quality and national consistency in the delivery of maternity services in New Zealand.This report presents the first year of these revised indicators. In addition to improved quality and completeness of the existing 12 indicators, three new indicators have been added that reflect care during pregnancy and the postnatal period and severe maternal morbidity.

Environmental variables, chosen for their correspondence to major tree physiological processes, included annual and seasonal temperature and solar radiation, soil and atmospheric water deficit, soil leaching, slope, and soil parent material and drainage. Environmental values were estimaged both for a large set of irregularly distributed plots describing forest composition, and points on a 1-km grid across New Zealand. Regressions were fitted to the ploy data species by species, with those for the four Nothofagus species also including terms to correct for the effects of their geographic disjunctions. Predictions of species abundance were then made for the grid data set, and the resulting matrix was classified to derive groups of similar composition. This data is expected to provide a context for both the assessment of the biodiversity value of surviving forest remnants and for the subsequent management and/or restoration of these sites.</p>	other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Other licensing (check with source agency)	http://lris.scinfo.org.nz/license/landcare-data-use-licence-v1/	2012-09-06 11:55:56		2012-02-16 16:35:36	2012-02-16 16:35:36	tag:lris.scinfo.org.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:279

Crash figures were analysed for the ten years from 2003 to 2012, with 53 deaths and 445 serious injuries recorded at the 100 highest-risk intersections over that period.A high-risk intersection is an intersection where it is likely that there will be fatal and serious crashes which could be prevented by effective countermeasures.

It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.

Potential Vegetation of New Zealand	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/289-potential-vegetation-of-new-zealand/	dataset	Landcare Research	Landcare Research	lris_support@landcareresearch.co.nz		<p>New Zealand's potential forest composition was predicted from regressions relating the distributions of major canopy tree species to environment. Environmental variables, chosen for their correspondence to major tree physiological processes, included annual and seasonal temperature and solar radiation, soil and atmospheric water deficit, soil leaching, slope, and soil parent material and drainage. Environmental values were estimaged both for a large set of irregularly distributed plots describing forest composition, and points on a 1-km grid across New Zealand. Regressions were fitted to the ploy data species by species, with those for the four Nothofagus species also including terms to correct for the effects of their geographic disjunctions. Predictions of species abundance were then made for the grid data set, and the resulting matrix was classified to derive groups of similar composition. This data is expected to provide a context for both the assessment of the biodiversity value of surviving forest remnants and for the subsequent management and/or restoration of these sites.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Landcare Data Use License	http://lris.scinfo.org.nz/license/landcare-data-use-licence-v1/	2012-09-04 15:54:45		2012-03-15 16:45:25	2012-03-15 16:45:25	tag:lris.scinfo.org.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:289

It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.

This is an area where it may be possible to grant additional shallow groundwater takes, without causing any significant cumulative adverse effects.  However this does not preclude the need for consent applicants to assess stream depletion effects as per Schedule WQN7 of Chapter 5 of the proposed Natural Resources Regional Plan (NRRP).</p><p>On 30 May 2005 the Councilâ€™s Water Allocation Panel (WAP) accepted a staff recommendation to formally recognise the Rakaia Riparian  sub-zone.  At this stage it is not intended to create a formal "sub-zone" within the Chertsey and Rakaia-Selwyn Zones (and recalculate allocation limits), this may be pursued at some future stage through a variation to the NRRP.  In the meantime any consents granted within the new sub-area will be counted as part of the "parent" zone.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2015-06-08 09:30:09		2015-08-02 21:20:30	2015-02-10 07:04:36	tag:data.canterburymaps.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:7613

This collection includes information about type of crime, location and outcome of investigation, as well as demographic attributes of victims, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and relationship of offender to victim. This is a rich data set that can be cross-tabulated many different ways. As a result, it provides considerable insight into which subsets of the population experience different types of crime. By including demographic attributes of victims, insights are possible into specific contexts, such as elder abuse, child sexual assault, intimate partner physical assault, and more.

Regional Wetlands	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7614-regional-wetlands/	dataset	Canterbury Regional Council	Canterbury Maps Partners	ecinfo@ecan.govt.nz		<p>The FENZ geodatabase provide a set of spatial layers describing environmental and biological patterns in New Zealandâ€™s freshwater ecosystems - rivers and streams, lakes and wetlands. The FENZ wetlands layer is focused on freshwater palustrine wetlands and standing waterbodies with a 500 m maximum length. It does not include estuarine, marine, riverine and lacustrine hydrosystems because these are (or will be) the focus of analogous classification and ranking projects.In 2003 Environment Canterbury provided the Department of Conservation with existing regional wetland survey information of the 1980s and 1990s, collated into a GIS database and report (Davis 1999). This, together with information from other national database's was checked against satellite imagery collected between September 1999 and 2003 to complete delineation of wetland extent. The baseline for â€˜currentâ€™ wetland extent in the FENZ wetland spatial layer is therefore 1999-2003. Coastal wetland vegetation/habitats were field surveyed, mapped onto aerial photographs, described and entered into a GIS database over the period 2004-2011. Mapped wetlands were described following the hierarchical classification system developed by Johnson and Gerbeaux (2004), which in turn drew on the wetland classification of Clarkson et al. (2003) and the vegetation/habitat mapping and description system of Atkinson (1985). 58 ground-surveyed coastal wetland areas are delimited in the Regional Wetland GIS database. A survey-dated description of each wetland, together with assessments of wetland condition, threats and ecological significance, is provided in the attributes table. The system of field survey and database reporting developed for the regionâ€™s coastal wetland habitats will now be applied to inland freshwater wetlands. Ground-based survey will be carried out to add to, update or improve delineation of wetland areas derived from FENZ, as well as provide a similar level of information on wetland class, vegetation type and overall ecological condition. Results of future wetland survey, ecological description and significance assessment will progressively be added to the Regional Wetland Database.ReferencesAtkinson, I.A.E. 1985.

The Plant Names Database lists over 36,000 names, including synonyms and incorrectly applied names. The database indicates which of the names are preferred for use at the Allan Herbarium (CHR), and provides information on the biostatus and the authorship of the taxa. It contains data for lichens, liverworts, hornworts, mosses, ferns, freshwater algae and seed plants in New Zealand. The Specimen Database is used to store and retrieve herbarium specimen information and to generate specimen labels. It currently contains over 150,000 records, or approximately 25% of the specimens in the herbarium. Information from the Plant Names Database and parts of the Specimen Database are available online at Nga Tipu Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants.<br /><br />The All New Zealand Species Database contains a list of all vascular plant species recorded as present in New Zealand. The database currently lists records for approximately 28 000 species and 7000 synonyms. These records are derived from a wide range of sources including the Allan Herbarium, horticultural societies, nursery catalogues, botanic gardens, arboreta, and published literature. This database is mainly used by the Plant Biodiversity and Biosecurity Information Services as a tool to help determine whether a species has been recorded in New Zealand.	online database	Other-Unknown	Unknown		Feed	Other licensing (check with source agency)		2011-06-08 17:54:42		2010-12-01 00:00:00		http://geospatial.govt.nz/browse-data-or-resources/dogetrecordbyid/e3e74683-3dc0-405b-9982-6826012b9680

Reserve Potassium	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/169-reserve-potassium/	dataset	Landcare Research	Landcare Research	lris_support@landcareresearch.co.nz		<p>Reserve potassium (Kc) is a measure how much potassium is available to plants. There are three potassium pools: dissolved, extractable, and reserve potassium. Potassium (K) is continuously drawn from the extractable to the dissolved pool when it is used by plants, and likewise from the reserve pool to the extractable pool. The reserve potassium is held in minerals in the soil such as mica. An example of the utility of this information is for organic farmers, who are not allowed to add potassium chloride to their soils (they can add potassium sulphate, but this is much more expensive). Class 3 for Kc will indicate where organic farming is practical. If you zoom in on the map and click on a soil area it will show the Kc class (pot class). The classes are:<br /></p><p>0 No data<br />1 Low    (0-0.3   cmolK/kg)<br />2 Medium (0.3-0.6 cmolK/kg<br />3 High   (>0.6    cmolK/kg)<br />4 Lakes<br />5 Alpine<br />6 Urban<br /></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Landcare Data Use License	http://lris.scinfo.org.nz/license/landcare-data-use-licence-v1/	2011-07-27 13:10:53		2011-10-13 14:22:35	2011-10-13 14:22:35	tag:lris.scinfo.org.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:169

River Type	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7527-river-type/	dataset	Canterbury Regional Council	Canterbury Maps Partners	ecinfo@ecan.govt.nz		<p>This layer was originally derived from NIWA's River Environment Classification which was modified as per Environment Canterbury's requirements (mainly related stream and river flow paths in flatter areas such as on the Canterbury Plains) for the Proposed Canterbury Natural Resources Regional Plan (NRRP). Note that the representation of a stream or river centreline in the units of this layer may not exactly align with the ground path of an actual water body. Units on this layer that seem to unexpectantly end are assumed to go subsurface. Water quality classes (as listed in the field Unit_WQ) Water quality classes have been defined for all rivers and lakes in the Canterbury region, excluding the areas covered by the operative Opihi and Proposed Waimakariri River regional plans and the Ahuriri River and Rakaia River water conservation orders. Each water quality class contains standards for water quality that are to be achieved for a point source discharge into a river or lake, after mixing of the discharge with the receiving water, in a defined zone. Field Value Display Name AOI;INL - Inland NAT - Natural ALP - Alpine HIL - Hill LOW - Lowland URB - Urban VOL - Volcanic AHU;WAI;RAK;OPI - Rivers and streams within areas covered by the Ahuriri & Rakaia River Water Conservation Order's, and the Opihi River & Proposed Waimakariri River Regional Plans.River and lake types (as listed in the field Unit_V6) The rivers and lakes of the Canterbury region have been grouped into different types that have similar physical and hydrological characteristics. The key physical characteristics that have been used to distinguish the different types of rivers and lakes include: flow, source and flow regime, morphology of rivers (shape), and water levels, size and depth of lakes. These characteristics influence the water quality of these water bodies, their associated aquatic ecosystems, and riparian margins. The objectives of Chapter 4 of the NRRP establish water quality outcomes for each of the river and lake types in the region. Chapter 5, Policy WQN4 provides indicator stream values to be considered when setting flow and level regimes for different river types in the region.

Each soil family is defined as a unique combination of attributes (NZSC classification, parent material, rock type, dominant texture and permeability class). Soil classes are further characterised as siblings according to their depth to rock class, stoniness, land type, drainage, texture (more detailed), functional horizons and miscellaneous variant information. The uncertainty of each of these family and sibling attribute classes is specifiedAssociated with the soil class layer will be additional map layers of fundamental and derived soil properties. The fundamental soil properties are depth (diggability), depth to slowly permeable layer, rooting depth, rooting barrier, horizon thickness, stoniness, clay and sand content. They are developed from sample information and expert knowledge. The derived soil layers are each based on a model (or pedo-transfer function). Some models are simple lookup tables that depend only on the soil class. Others combine various soil, land use, vegetation, climate or topographic attributes in a mathematical formula. Derived layers will include available water (mm), macroporosity, water retention, bulk density, total carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, cation exchange capacity, pH, and phosphorus retention.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Landcare Data Use License	http://lris.scinfo.org.nz/license/landcare-data-use-licence-v1/	2014-12-01 08:38:57		2014-11-24 09:26:17	2014-11-24 09:26:17	tag:lris.scinfo.org.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:417

There is also new mapping in the Manawatu and around Otaki.The Profile Available Water (PAW) pedo-transfer function has been further improved. This has resulted in revised PAW estimates for all soils, and changes to some risk categories. The Overseer fields on the factsheets have been updated. The S-map reference name now has an additional character e.g. Raka_3.1 is now Raka_3a.1.

Salmon Spawning Sites	https://data.canterburymaps.govt.nz/layer/7620-salmon-spawning-sites/	dataset	Canterbury Regional Council	Canterbury Maps Partners	ecinfo@ecan.govt.nz		<p>This layer shows lengths of Canterbury Rivers that are deamed as a significant spawning sites for salmon. Based from Schedule WQN14 Chapter 5 of the NRRP.Grid References were converted to NZTM2000 to make upstream and downstream extent markers. LINZ NZTopo50 River data was used as a basis to create this feature class.As a number of sites do not have an upstream map reference and instead have a contour that indicates the upper extent of the spawning area. The reason for this is that these streams generally include several tributaries and all are significant. The reference to the contour is intended to capture all tributaries feeding into the stream above its lower reference point.</p><p>Copyright statement: Environment Canterbury</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2015-06-08 09:30:09		2015-08-03 02:17:10	2015-02-10 07:04:47	tag:data.canterburymaps.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:7620

The datasets contain a series of Customs Tariff and Concession data. These datasets are derived from The Working Tariff Document of New Zealand (http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/tariff/Pages/default.aspx) and you can look up this information on this website. An description of each set is given below.Please note that as some of the descriptions in these files could contain a comma, each dataset uses the tilde character ~ as the field delimiter.Tariff DatasetsThe Tariff zip file contains of four .csv files:- Tariff Details, Tariff Rates, Tariff Levies and Tariff Levy Formulas and the time stamp txt file. The Tariff Details, Tariff Rates, Tariff Levies are linked by the tariff item levels 1 - 5. Each tariff item can be read as a whole, e.g. 12.34.56.78.90X but can be broken into 5 levels of 2 numbers each plus a check letter. The levels areChapterHeadingSub-headingItemStatistical key - usually quoted with the check letter, i.e. 90XThe Tariff Details file provides information relating to the tariff item itself giving start and end date, description, check letter and any statistical or supplementary units required. The remaining fields can pretty much be ignored. The Tariff Rates file contains the tariff item, rate group, e.g. lesser developed Countries (LDC), the start and end date for each rate and the formula and factors used to calculate the duty. The Tariff Levies file is similar to the Tariff Rates file but relates to levies for example the ALAC (Alcohol Advisory Council) etc. The rate corresponding to the levy formula is contained in the Tariff Levy Formulas .csv file. The time stamp file contains the date and time the last time these files were updatedConcession DatasetsThe Concession zip file contains of three .csv files:- Concession Details, Concession Rates, Concession to Tariff and the time stamp txt file. The concession files follow the same lines as the Tariff download in that each file is linked by the concession code. The details and rates file follow the same basic principles of the tariff files. The concession to tariff file shows the tariff items that the concession applies to. The use of ** in the concession to tariff file denotes that the concession applies to this whole tariff level e.g. 23 04 ** ** ** means that the concession applies to all tariff heading 2304. For all other tariff enquiries please get in touch with the National Contact Centre.

Threatened Environments Classification 2012	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/282-threatened-environments-classification-2012/	dataset	Landcare Research	Landcare Research	lris_support@landcareresearch.co.nz		<p>This layer comes from the Threatened Environment Classification (TEC) version 2012, which is a source of national scale background information on New Zealand's land environments. Specifically, it shows how much native (indigenous) vegetation remains within land environments, and how past vegetation loss and legal protection are distributed across New Zealand's landscape. The TEC uses indigenous vegetation as a surrogate for indigenous biodiversity. This includes indigenous ecosystems, habitats and communities: the indigenous species, subspecies and varieties that are supported by indigenous vegetation, and their genetic diversity. The TEC is most appropriately applied to help identify places that are priorities for formal protection against clearance and/or incompatible land-uses, and for ecological restoration to restore lost species, linkages and buffers. The TEC is a combination of three national databases: Land Environments New Zealand (LENZ), classes of the 4th Land Cover Database (LCDB4, based on 2012 satellite imagery) and the protected areas network (version 2012, reflecting areas legally protected for the purpose of natural heritage protection).<br /></p><p>For more information see: Cieraad E, Walker S, Price R, Barringer J. 2015.

These zones differ from the zones in the 1:300,000 map (Figure 1), and from the 1:250,000 QMAP geological map unit boundaries, but are assumed to be more accurate.</p><p>Copyright statement: Dataset created by Helen Jack, Environment Canterbury, 2013.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2015-06-08 09:30:09		2015-05-10 22:26:17	2015-02-10 02:47:27	tag:data.canterburymaps.govt.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:7544

It optimises the cartographic potential of the vegetation information available in the early 1980s and provides a historical record which will aid in future analyses of vegetative cover and land utilisation. The map classification recognises 47 Vegetative Cover Classes identified by alphanumeric code and 17 Vegetative Cover Elements identified (only on the printed map) by symbols and patterns. The map is published as two sheets 730mm x 880mm covering the three principal islands of New Zealand and all offshore islands within 100km of the coast. The map was accompanied by a 153 page, illustrated, book which discusses New Zealand's vegetation and describes the 47 classes.<br /></p><p>The book to accompany this dataset is available as an epub from:<br /><a href="https://mebooks.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=402">mebooks.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&prod...</a> .<br /></p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo,api	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Landcare Data Use License	http://lris.scinfo.org.nz/license/landcare-data-use-licence-v1/	2015-05-22 11:50:38		2015-05-21 12:52:17	2015-05-21 12:52:17	tag:lris.scinfo.org.nz,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:420

Vulnerability to Soil Structural Degradation	https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/168-vulnerability-to-soil-structural-degradation/	dataset	Landcare Research	Landcare Research	lris_support@landcareresearch.co.nz		<p>Untimely cultivation, grazing and forestry operations when the soils are wet give rise to a rapid and marked loss of soil structure and a reduction in soil permeability and aeration owing to the compaction, deformation and consolidation of the topsoil and upper subsoil. This degradation results from the pressure of heavy machinery or treading by stock. Some soils are more at risk than others due to their poor resistance and resilience to compacting forces, poor drainage, limited water holding capacity, or higher rainfall.<br /></p><p>References<br />Parfitt, R.

It represents this species' final layer as part of the Natural Heritage Management Strategy of the Department of Conservation.<br /></p><p>Spatial and textual data were collected at the Area level by Department of Conservation Area Office and Conservancy Office staff.  Polygons representing the distribution were hand-drawn onto LINZ 260 series topo maps at the 1:250,000 scale.  Digitisation of the hand-drawn maps was contracted to Geographx (NZ) Limited.<br /></p><p>Freshwater lakes, ponds and rivers were clipped from the layer to represent species absence. Further digitisation work was carried out by the DOC R&D GIS team in Christchurch to re-define selected polygons by species specific distribution drivers; i.e. altitude and habitat guided by LCBD 2.  The attribute table may contain references to quantitative datasets of species abundance (where such datasets exist).<br /></p><p>For full explanation of data collection methodology see DOCDM-186114.</p>	csv,kml/shp,other geo	Other-Unknown	No		Feed	Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence		2010-10-06 08:55:56		2010-09-24 02:59:04		tag:koordinates.com,2010-07:feed:data.govt.nz:layer:1613

Women’s Franchise Petitions 1892 and 1893	http://www.digitalnz.org/records?i[content_partner]=Archives+New+Zealand+Te+Rua+Mahara+o+te+K%C4%81wanatanga&i[display_collection]=Shared+Repository	dataset	Department of Internal Affairs	Digital Continuity	digitalcontinuity@dia.govt.nz	044995595	When Governor Glasgow signed the Electoral Bill on 19 September 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world where women had won the right to vote. The Bill was the outcome of years of meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often traveling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions and sign petitions. A number of petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament from the early 1880s till 1893. Only two of these historically important documents are known to have survived and both are preserved at Archives New Zealand. The first of these was the unsuccessful 1892 women‘s franchise petition containing approximately 20,000 signatures. This was the culmination of many years work by the Women‘s Christian Temperance Movement and prominent suffragist, Kate Sheppard. Despite the failure of this initial petition, another was organised in 1893, and was described by Kate Sheppard as "a monster petition" demanding the right for women to vote. Petition sheets, circulated throughout New Zealand, were returned to Christchurch where Kate Sheppard pasted each sheet end on end and rolled it around a section of a broom handle. The resulting roll contained 23,853 signatures and, with the addition of 7,000 further signatures before it was presented to Parliament, the petition attained the suffragists‘ original target of 30,000 signatories. The roll was presented to Parliament with great drama. John Hall, Member of Parliament and suffrage supporter, brought it into the house and unrolled it down the central aisle of the debating chamber until it hit the end wall with a thud. The 1893 women‘s franchise petition is on display in the Constitution Room at Archives New Zealand, Wellington, along with a facsimile of the first sheet, bearing the signature of Kate Sheppard. A microfilm copy of the full petition is available in Archives New Zealand‘s public reading room, along with an alphabetical name index of signatories and a transcript with geographical listings. The dataset includes data that has been transcribed from the original handwritten petition. Some names and locations were illegible and have not been included.
