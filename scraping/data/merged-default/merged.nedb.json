The datasets contain a series of Customs Tariff and Concession data. These datasets are derived from The Working Tariff Document of New Zealand (http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/tariff/Pages/default.aspx) and you can look up this information on this website. An description of each set is given below.Please note that as some of the descriptions in these files could contain a comma, each dataset uses the tilde character ~ as the field delimiter.Tariff DatasetsThe Tariff zip file contains of four .csv files:- Tariff Details, Tariff Rates, Tariff Levies and Tariff Levy Formulas and the time stamp txt file. The Tariff Details, Tariff Rates, Tariff Levies are linked by the tariff item levels 1 - 5. Each tariff item can be read as a whole, e.g. 12.34.56.78.90X but can be broken into 5 levels of 2 numbers each plus a check letter. The levels areChapterHeadingSub-headingItemStatistical key - usually quoted with the check letter, i.e. 90XThe Tariff Details file provides information relating to the tariff item itself giving start and end date, description, check letter and any statistical or supplementary units required. The remaining fields can pretty much be ignored. The Tariff Rates file contains the tariff item, rate group, e.g. lesser developed Countries (LDC), the start and end date for each rate and the formula and factors used to calculate the duty. The Tariff Levies file is similar to the Tariff Rates file but relates to levies for example the ALAC (Alcohol Advisory Council) etc. The rate corresponding to the levy formula is contained in the Tariff Levy Formulas .csv file. The time stamp file contains the date and time the last time these files were updatedConcession DatasetsThe Concession zip file contains of three .csv files:- Concession Details, Concession Rates, Concession to Tariff and the time stamp txt file. The concession files follow the same lines as the Tariff download in that each file is linked by the concession code. The details and rates file follow the same basic principles of the tariff files. The concession to tariff file shows the tariff items that the concession applies to. The use of ** in the concession to tariff file denotes that the concession applies to this whole tariff level e.g. 23 04 ** ** ** means that the concession applies to all tariff heading 2304.

It may be linked to other agencies, most commonly those that came before or after it, or were in control of or controlled by it.There are 5740 approved agencies documented in Archway (Archives New Zealand's online finding aids database) as at 26 June 2013.  These agencies are categorised into the following types:Person (Individuals who transfer records to Archives New Zealand)                         Central government agency                 Local government agency                   District Health Boards                             State schools               Universities                                         Polytechnics                  Other, including Courts, State Owned Enterprises and private companies                              The agencies listed here are only a subset of those documented on Archway.

Information from the Plant Names Database and parts of the Specimen Database are available online at Nga Tipu Aotearoa - New Zealand Plants.<br /><br />The All New Zealand Species Database contains a list of all vascular plant species recorded as present in New Zealand. The database currently lists records for approximately 28 000 species and 7000 synonyms. These records are derived from a wide range of sources including the Allan Herbarium, horticultural societies, nursery catalogues, botanic gardens, arboreta, and published literature.

The Bill was the outcome of years of meetings in towns and cities across the country, with women often traveling considerable distances to hear lectures and speeches, pass resolutions and sign petitions. A number of petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament from the early 1880s till 1893. Only two of these historically important documents are known to have survived and both are preserved at Archives New Zealand. The first of these was the unsuccessful 1892 women‘s franchise petition containing approximately 20,000 signatures. This was the culmination of many years work by the Women‘s Christian Temperance Movement and prominent suffragist, Kate Sheppard. Despite the failure of this initial petition, another was organised in 1893, and was described by Kate Sheppard as \"a monster petition\" demanding the right for women to vote. Petition sheets, circulated throughout New Zealand, were returned to Christchurch where Kate Sheppard pasted each sheet end on end and rolled it around a section of a broom handle. The resulting roll contained 23,853 signatures and, with the addition of 7,000 further signatures before it was presented to Parliament, the petition attained the suffragists‘ original target of 30,000 signatories. The roll was presented to Parliament with great drama. John Hall, Member of Parliament and suffrage supporter, brought it into the house and unrolled it down the central aisle of the debating chamber until it hit the end wall with a thud. The 1893 women‘s franchise petition is on display in the Constitution Room at Archives New Zealand, Wellington, along with a facsimile of the first sheet, bearing the signature of Kate Sheppard. A microfilm copy of the full petition is available in Archives New Zealand‘s public reading room, along with an alphabetical name index of signatories and a transcript with geographical listings. The dataset includes data that has been transcribed from the original handwritten petition. Some names and locations were illegible and have not been included.","format":"SPREADSHEET","updatefrequency":"Other-Unknown","cost":"No","submissionsource":"Public","licence":"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence","date listed":"2011-09-19 12:48:54","date last updated":"2013-02-05 00:00:00","datasetlastupdated":"2013-02-05 00:00:00","datasetcreation":"2013-01-22 00:00:00","source":"data-govt-nz"}],"sha1":"f2576d2d2edf2e22699701ba36cea242ab5b8adc","_id":"gBZCV5OH4LnqLSir"}

Building on previous work undertaken across Australasia, an expert working group has established a set of 12 maternity clinical indicators that are relevant to the New Zealand setting and can be measured using available data collections. This third report presents data for 2011 using the same standardised definitions as in the previous two reports (2009 and 2010).  This is also the third report using the standard primipara definition which allows the separate assessment of a group of women for whom interventions and outcomes should be similar. In addition to eight indicators for standard primiparae, there are three indicators for all women giving birth in hospital and one indicator covering all babies born in hospital. This report provides an opportunity for district health boards (DHBs) and local maternity stakeholders to identify areas for further investigation at a local level as part of local maternity quality and safety programmes. A time series view of three years of indicators data as an interactive dataset accompanies this third report and enables analysis of local and national trends over time.","format":"Spreadsheet,PDF,Other","updatefrequency":"Annually","cost":"No","submissionsource":"Manual","licence":"Other licensing (check with source agency)","date listed":"2014-04-09 10:54:17","date last updated":"2014-04-08 00:00:00","datasetlastupdated":"2014-04-08 00:00:00","datasetcreation":"2013-05-20 00:00:00","source":"data-govt-nz"}],"sha1":"ec042027d1714a1656156491c8c29237d9335947","_id":"jf1yuPkr9uFEsZ3C"}

Individual river sections are mapped according to physical factors such as climate, source of flow for the river water, topography, and geology, and catchment land cover eg, forest, pasture or urban. Sections of river that have similar ecological characteristics can then be grouped together, no matter where they are.<br /></p><p>This information is mapped for New Zealand's entire river network - over 425,000 kilometres of river. Different types of rivers respond differently to the pressures placed on them - the REC can be used to highlight the most appropriate management tools and approaches to reduce these pressures for each river type. Information from the classification is used to develop policy, assess the environment, and report on the quality of river water.<br /></p><p>Stream order is the numerical position of a tributary or section of a river within the entire network. Headwater streams are assigned a stream order of 1. When two tributaries of the same stream order meet, the order increments by one for the next section downstream. However, if two sections meet where one section has higher order than the other, the next section downstream has the same order as the highest upstream section.<br /></p><p>The User Guide is available from <a href=\"https://data.mfe.govt.nz/document/123-rec-user-guide-2010/\">data.mfe.govt.nz/document/123-rec-user-guide-2010/</a> .

These proposed changes were further reviewed and developed by the original expert working group to ensure the objectives of the New Zealand Maternity Clinical Indicators were retained; that being a tool for assessing the quality and national consistency in the delivery of maternity services in New Zealand.This report presents the first year of these revised indicators.

These records were transferred from various NZDF agencies over recent years, with about 29 transfers from NZDF Personnel Archives in the last decade.As each transfer was completed the data format and logic sequence was maintained within each accession as part of the process.  Records were also processed to link to various agencies, and categorised into different series by the nature of the record and their relationships.  This means the NZDF personnel files are dispersed into various series and accessions, and to access all of these records users need to have in-depth knowledge about the evolution of NZDF and about how archives are managed.This list aims to help people overcome the above obstacles through standardising the format of names and sorting all entries into a unique sequence (alphabetical order by surname) across all transfers of NZDF personnel files, which will support the most simple and common access path to these records by users.NZDF personnel files are composed of the original personnel files, military history sheets, and microfilm strip copies of original personnel files that were destroyed after microfilming in the 1970s.  Each entry in the list is a surrogate of a file within our collection, however individuals could have more than one file.It should also be noted that this list is no more than reorganisation of the dataset of Archives’ finding aids Archway, any real requests should be made through Archway with the related archives reference.","format":"Spreadsheet","updatefrequency":"Other-Unknown","cost":"No","submissionsource":"Manual","licence":"Other licensing (check with source agency)","date listed":"2015-03-16 09:52:42","date last updated":"2015-03-10 00:00:00","datasetlastupdated":"2015-03-10 00:00:00","datasetcreation":"2015-03-10 00:00:00","source":"data-govt-nz"}],"sha1":"72958f067d1c9150ebf0316f0f751c4d4d769700","_id":"wrOH9KNjqsH0McfF"}
